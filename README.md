# n-resistor-voltage-divider
A small script to get the voltage drop across individual resistor in n resistor branch. 
Upon launching you will be asked about the higher of terminal voltage, after that on next input you just have to enter the n number of resistors space separated with each other, and just pess enter
you will have the output showing the voltage drop across each resistor in the text based diagram format.
